# Svelte Material UI - Banner

Banners display important, succinct messages. They can provide actions for the user to take. They requires user action to be dismissed.

Banners are persistent and non-modal, and they should be displayed at the top of the viewport, below a top app bar. Only one banner should be shown to the user at any time.
