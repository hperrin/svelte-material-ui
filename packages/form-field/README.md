# Whoa There, These Docs are Outdated

The latest SMUI v3 had a lot of changes, and these docs haven't been caught up yet. You should check out the demo page's code to see the latest usage.

# Basic Usage

```svelte
<FormField>
  <Checkbox bind:checked={amIChecked} />
  <span slot="label">Am I Checked</span>
</FormField>

<script>
  import FormField from '@smui/form-field';
  import Checkbox from '@smui/checkbox';

  let amIChecked = false;
</script>
```

# Exports

## (default)

A Form Field component.

### Props / Defaults

- `use`: `[]` - An array of Svelte actions and/or arrays of an action and its options.
- `class`: `''` - A CSS class string.
- `align`: `'start'` - Where to align the input. ('start' or 'end')
- `inputId`: `(programatically assigned)` - The ID of the input the label is to be associated with.

The ID is generated using a module context counter, so you don't need to provide one yourself. The format is `SMUI-form-field-{counter}`, and the counter starts at 0.

### Forwarded Props

- `label$` - Props forwarded to the label element.
