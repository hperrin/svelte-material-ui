# Whoa There, These Docs are Outdated

The latest SMUI v3 had a lot of changes, and these docs haven't been caught up yet. You should check out the demo page's code to see the latest usage.

# Basic Usage

```svelte
<Select
  bind:value={fruitChoice}
  label="Fruit"
  anchor$class="select-width"
  menu$class="select-width"
>
  <Option value="" />
  {#each fruits as fruit}
    <Option value={fruit}>{fruit}</Option>
  {/each}
</Select>

<script>
  import Select, { Option } from '@smui/select';

  let fruits = ['Apple', 'Orange', 'Banana', 'Mango'];
  let fruitChoice = '';
</script>

<style>
  * :global(.select-width) {
    min-width: 200px;
  }
</style>
```
