# Svelte Material UI - Base

SMUI Base contains core foundation and component classes that serve as the base classes for all of SMUI's foundation classes and components (respectively).

Most of the time, you shouldn't need to depend on `smui-base` directly. It is useful however if you'd like to write custom components that follow SMUI's pattern and elegantly integrate with the SMUI ecosystem.

NOTE: THIS PACKAGE IS JUST TRANSITIONAL! DON'T USE IT!
