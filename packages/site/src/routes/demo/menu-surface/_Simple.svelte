<MenuSurface static style="max-width: 350px;">
  <p style="margin: 1em;">
    This is a menu surface. It's similar to a menu. It is more versatile, but
    requires more configuration. It can contain more than just a list, like rich
    popover content, forms, images, etc.

  import MenuSurface from '@smui/menu-surface';
